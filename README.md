# Interview Prep
I created this repo as a means of tracking problems that I am working on for interview prep. Leetcode is a fine resource for reviewing and practicing interview questions but it doesn't always challenge me in a lot of practical areas of embedded system development.

My GitHub tends to be sparse because, throughout my career, companies have not used GitHub and have not allowed code to leave their servers. 

The hope is that this offers another glimpse into what I am working on and trying to practice. It is often hard to portray this.
